/**
 * Toolchain integrity guard — `overrides` must not break the tools they patch.
 *
 * Why this file exists: on 2026-07-29 a *flat* `"brace-expansion": "^5.0.8"` override was
 * merged to silence GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg. It forced every minimatch onto brace-expansion v5,
 * whose entry point changed shape:
 *
 *     v1/v2  module.exports = expand            // callable
 *     v5     module.exports = { expand, ... }   // named exports only
 *
 * minimatch@3 and @5 do `const expand = require('brace-expansion')` and then call it, so they
 * threw `TypeError: expand is not a function` on any pattern containing a brace.
 *
 * Measured in *this* tree on 2026-07-29 (#195), under the flat override — 3 of the 4 installed
 * minimatch copies threw on `a{b,c}d`:
 *
 *     10.2.6  node_modules/minimatch                                     ok
 *     3.1.5   node_modules/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/node_modules/minimatch  THREW
 *     3.1.5   node_modules/eslint-plugin-import/node_modules/minimatch    THREW
 *     5.1.9   node_modules/@redocly/openapi-core/node_modules/minimatch   THREW
 *
 * …and `npm run lint`, `npm run codegen` and the whole of `npm run check` still exited 0,
 * because nothing they do feeds a brace pattern through. **Running the gates is not a probe.**
 * That is why this guard exists as a test rather than as a step in a runbook: green CI is not
 * the same as a working toolchain, and the difference is invisible until someone writes
 * `{a,b}` in a config.
 *
 * The guard: resolve every minimatch actually installed and run a brace pattern through it.
 * Any override that reintroduces the incompatibility fails here instead of hiding.
 *
 * Copied from the fleet reference (nene-deal PR #175) and re-measured here — the path list
 * above is this repo's, not deal's.
